  \begin{block}{\textbf{Why the Spalart-Allmaras Model for Moltres?}}
    Provides reasonable estimates for turbulent effects in MSRs and is tractable for large problems
    on small computing clusters.

  \begin{block}{\textbf{Proposed Work}}
    \textbf{Implementation of a Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model in Moltres}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Implement a Spalart-Allmaras model in Moltres
      \item Verify and validate the model against published data for backward-facing step problem
      \item Compare the model against published data of turbulent salt flow in the Molten Salt Fast
        Reactor
    \end{itemize}
