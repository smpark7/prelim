As identified in Sections \ref{sec:msre-critique} and \ref{sec:msfr-critique},
Moltres will benefit from more rigorous validation and verification of its
\gls{MSR} modeling capabilities. Owing to the limited availability of \gls{MSR}
experimental data, verification work presently represents the better option for
assessing Moltres' simulation accuracy. Therefore, this chapter presents
results from Moltres for problems within the CNRS Benchmark
\cite{tiberga_results_2020}---a numerical benchmark specifically designed to
assess \gls{MSR} simulation tools on coupled, multiphysics simulations of
fast-spectrum \glspl{MSR}. The benchmark consists of several steps in which
steady-state and transient simulations are prescribed. Starting from simple,
single-physics cases, subsequent steps incrementally introduce various types of
multiphysics coupling until full coupling is achieved in the final steps. This
gradual approach helps participants identify sources of discrepancies
which can arise from differences in modeling assumptions or
cross-section libraries, or actual errors in the software. I adapted the
contents of this chapter from my work in a manuscript titled
``\textit{Verification of Moltres for Multiphysics Simulations of Fast-Spectrum
Molten Salt Reactors}'' and submitted to the Annals of Nuclear Energy for
publication.
